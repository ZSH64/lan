**Aislin:**
I think that's it for me for now. Perfecrt, I'll hande it over to Christian.


As Asilin said I am the product devops and delivery lead here in our Dublin Office. I am currently the only one in Dublin who is working  in the Devops Domain. ANd I've been with a company just under four month now
I still feel green myself. I've got previus experince as a Devops engenere and cloud enegener and the infrastructure enggener. But this position is much more for the governance level
