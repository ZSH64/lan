**Aislin:**
I think that's it for me for now. Perfect, I'll hand it over to Christian.


As Asilin said, I am the product DevOps and delivery lead here in our Dublin Office. I am currently the only one in Dublin working  in the DevOps Domain. And I've been with a company just under four months now
I still feel green myself. **I've got previus experince as a** Devops engenere and cloud enegener and the infrastructure enegener. But this position is much more in **the governance level**, much more dealing with processes and dealing with supporting our engineer in the US throughout optimizing various DevOps workflows, specifically CI/CD pipelines and stuff like that. Because of the large nature of the company, we have a bit of separation between our infrastructure our **RunOps team** and our DevOps team.So that's where more of the focus for us is. This is the DevOps Engineer role, which should be one of two. A candidate for this role would be working quite closely with me.
In the same way that I am providing this support in the governance kind of level, and the engineers will be **providing support** much more **lower-level, much more technical manner**,in terms of working closely with me and how we provide that support through new initiatives, a new potential optimisation that can help and improve the waller greens. CI/CD kind of workflow. That was a little bit about me as well as the role.


We can jump right into some high-level technical questions, to get a better sense of your experience throughout your various previous rules before moving on to Aislimng's questions, which should be more culturally based.
