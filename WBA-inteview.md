**Aislin:**
I think that's it for me for now. Perfect, I'll hand it over to Christian.


As Asilin said, I am the product DevOps and delivery lead here in our Dublin Office. I am currently the only one in Dublin working  in the DevOps Domain. And I've been with a company just under four months now
I still feel green myself. **I've got previus experince as a** Devops engenere and cloud enegener and the infrastructure enegener. But this position is much more in **the governance level**, much more dealing with processes and dealing with supporting our engineer in the US throughout optimizing various DevOps workflows, specifically CI/CD pipelines and stuff like that. Because of the large nature of the company, we have a bit of separation between our infrastructure our **RunOps team** and our DevOps team.So that's where more of the focus for us is. This is the DevOps Engineer role, which should be one of two. A candidate for this role would be working quite closely with me.
In the same way that I am providing this support in the governance kind of level, and the engineers will be **providing support** much more **lower-level, much more technical manner**,in terms of working closely with me and how we provide that support through new initiatives, a new potential optimisation that can help and improve the waller greens. CI/CD kind of workflow. That was a little bit about me as well as the role.


We can jump right into some high-level technical questions to get a better sense of your experience throughout your various previous rules before moving on to Aislimng's questions, which should be more culturally based.

Let's start with one that we usually do. Would you tell me a little bit about yourself? Your relevant experience to this role. **I see you've got extended experience working as a software
developer engineer and you moved more over to an SRE role**. Yeah, go right ahead.

**We can jump into that as we go**. speaking a which first. you mentioned how you worked with the CI/CD pipeline; could you expand a little bit more on the tools you use there? As well as a type of pipeline you build, maintain, and optimize.

--------------------
Okay, interesting. That is a good example of having your own opinion, needing to know what the company needs at that moment, and you can slowly change it over time. that is a good example.

When dealing with various CI/CD pipelines that you've developed, how would you generally handle the failing builds?

--------------
You mentioned working with k8s and Docker; how would you compare to? which do you prefer? and what is the major difference you see between the two?
Docker Container or k8s deployments?

---------------------------------

I think you are getting part of the question, you can have k8s as an orchestrator and in the same way, you can have helm as an orchestrator, why would you use k8s pod
as you are right it utilises a Docker container within it? but Why would you use that over just a straight Docker container by itself?

You are definitely on the right track there; that's what I was looking for: the difference between orchestration. You've nailed it.

------------------

Speaking of orchestration and handling with K8s as you mentioned, you have a couple of different clusters. If the K8s deployment had gone down, how would you investigate that problem?

------------------
Tha's good coveregae your difffrent levels of kind of monitoring and observability, but when it omes to actually investigating let's say deployment has gone down and the pod has gone down.
You've been told through graffana and you've been told through promethouse what the problem is there. How do you investigate the actuall problem itself.

Let's say the pod is still up and running, I needed you to access that pod via your terminal what kube controll command would you use to kind of access on running po
