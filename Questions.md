**Terraform:**
- where did you use Terraform?
- When you use Terraform, it needs to save the state to a file or some other location. How did you manage the state in the Terraform script?
- Terraform has some problems with storing secrets; basically, it stores the secret in open text. How did you work around that? This includes passwords, certificates, and any other sensitive data.



**Automation Tools**
- did you have some windows between where you kept the old server and you need to bring the new service? **how was that process orchestrated?** how did you do that?
- How much of the entire journey was automated?
- Aside from Terraform, do you have any hands-on experience with other similar tools that allow you to manage VMs, provision them, or perform some kind of automation on those VMs?



**Monitoring:**
- do you have the motoring at the top of the stack?
- How did you send notifications?
- How large was the cluster in terms of number of servers?
- Any experience with **Promethouse, Graffana.**


**Support:**
- Did you play any role in L1 or L2 support? Would those tickets be assigned to you?


**k8s**
 - You mentioend AWS and Azure, where was that k8s runing actually?
 - How did you handle situations where a team **overused the cluster** resources, such as excessive memory and CPU consumption?
 - Have you provisioned your own K8s server or K8s cluster, even aside from all your work experience? Did you do that for your own purposes as exercises? Did you try to create the K8s cluster on a server or on your local machine?
 - What advantages do you see in using K8s in general?
 - Do you see any workload that you'd never put in K8s for some reason?
 - Do you see any workload that you'd never put in K8s for some reason? If I told you we have a cluster of VMs and want to cut costs by moving them all to K8s, is there any use case you consider not suitable for K8s?

**Linux:**
Do you have any hands-on experience with managing Linux or operating Linux VMs?
