Just busy early in the morning you knwo!
How are you doing?
I've read your emaiul about the CPU increase, everything is going smotly noe? it is better? we have beutifuly documented as well
You actually provided the cost which is morethan I was expecting, which is greate! thank you. 100 eutos is not ganna killed us, dont worry


You were asking me yesterday about if Kris is going back on Monday, no He is not comming back on Monday, He's be off sick for a while. Lets have a chat about a couple of things to adress with you
Hold on, I have some notes here!

So, considering that, So james is be joing on the 4 of July, So next Thusday week
I requested he set up on the users so we can proceed with that, VDI is being provided.. So he weill be able to access the VDI. That would be fine 
Then considering that very likely Kris is not gana be here to take him onboard and I'm actully not around the 4, I was wondering if you can show him around? not the ofiice obvously you can have have a chat with him on the how is our archetcture
How are we set up and excetraa. Just to show him around, Becuase the initial Plan is, I knwo Kris wants to help us with somethings, I would belive that he wanted james to do onbehalf uyou, on behalf more capacity on the run side of things
operatinaly 
Thats good becuase thats the mostly are  your working on, with very close to squad and you are very much on the keep teh lights on and moving things live and exectra.
So If you can start just by showing him that, that would be greate!
is it that you will be to do that?

Another thing:
For the moment we only have you to support this , we were parking here with Paul and Dave, maybe there are something taht you can think but can help you, regards of why  I dont want is people not only in Allianz Tecnology but us just start asking you Zahra can
can you do this, can you do that, and then you say I can not do this I need a hand ookey?
What can we do, (hold a second I need to as, sorry the Paul was pinging me) would it boundly a request as in you get in teh request, once specific day or week, Like I90 change controll happens on tursday, so If we agreed with the
ciustomer, well the Kris is off what we can do is on Wendsday you recice information and then you can procees it or you need it by thiseday so you can proiccess it on thursday, so this is just an example right 
just bold the request, if you can think((I dont need teh answer now), can you give me Todaay, next week whenever you fil
As Kris is off and you are teh only one from Facing customer and on ourselfs and teh deployments, how can we help you for you that you dont get overwhemed or you can get over everything
, Produuct is
Woould it help also that one above them request and also limit teh amount of people that we will be teling or will be alowing to contact you, It is ganna be form this people,
product is ganna to talking these peple, SO have a think on how has it worked untill now, this is a temprory thing ojk,
SO how can we help you just to have it everything under controll

then there is another bit which is, we know that James is comming so you can show him around interms of operanally and also we can have other people you
I knwo that Dave was explaning, some of our guys can deploye things up at the certain stage, they knwo and they good kknwo how to do it for their own but they just dont have the autority
so if you could think interms of autority, we could provide temprorly some people in out rangs obviously,I'm not saying 10, I'm saying one or two people, they knwo how this works, so they could help you moving
