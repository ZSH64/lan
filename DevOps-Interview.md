- you mentioned how you worked with the CI/CD pipeline; could you expand a little bit more on the tools you use there? As well as a type of pipeline you build, maintain, and optimize.
- **I see you've got extended experience working as a software developer engineer and you moved more over to an SRE role**. Yeah, go right ahead.
- When dealing with various CI/CD pipelines that you've developed, how would you generally handle the failing builds?

-------------------------

- You mentioned working with k8s and Docker; how would you compare to? which do you prefer? and what is the major difference you see between the two?
Docker Container or k8s deployments?


-------

- why would you use k8s pod as you are right it utilises a Docker container in it? Why would you use that over just a straight Docker container by itself?
- If the K8s deployment was to go down, how would you investigate that problem?
- Let's say the pod is still up and running, I needed you to access that pod via your terminal what kube controll command would you use to kind of access on running pod?

I've been there, you've get stear it into your brain after a while isnt it?
