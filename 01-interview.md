I've been with Allianz since 2020, so I joined arount the peak epidemic. My role was to design and implement the infrastructure in Azure. we can talk about technology choices in a minute. IÂ£ve been told to build up teh infrastructure 
to host the applications which are currently people from the development move from on-prem infrastrucure. we have backet of windows base applications in .net and they re-wrote large chunk of it in .net core,
basiclly the are migrated that to host on k8s
