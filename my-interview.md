Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today!

My name is Zahra, and I’m a DevOps Engineer at Allianz Ireland. My primary role involves maintaining our cloud infrastructure and implementing CI/CD processes. I work closely with our cloud solution architect, and together, we form the core of the DevOps team here at Allianz Ireland.

We began our journey about three and a half years ago. Since then, we have collaboratively built the entire infrastructure and the operational sites surrounding it. Our main platform is Azure. We run Windows applications on the App Service Environment and .NET Core applications on Kubernetes clusters. Currently, we manage six custom-built Kubernetes clusters, which are isolated from one another to ensure robust security and performance.

In terms of DevOps practices, we have a comprehensive setup including various metrics and dashboards that help us monitor and manage our infrastructure effectively. Our team is responsible for overseeing these clusters and providing support to other teams.

As our applications continue to expand, we are looking to grow our team. We’re seeking a DevOps professional who is keen on automation, has a solid understanding of cloud technology, and is adept at maintaining operational standards. This role isn’t about building from scratch but rather about enhancing and sustaining our existing infrastructure.

Do you have any questions before we proceed?
